      "\n",
      "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\n",
      "in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\n",
      "transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous\n",
      "efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\n",
      "architectures [38, 24, 15].\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\n",
      "sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\n",
      "states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\n",
      "sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\n",
      "sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\n",
      "significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\n",
      "computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\n",
      "constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\n",
      "the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\n",
      "are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\n",
      "relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
      "The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\n",
      "translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2 Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n",
      "\n",
      "[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\n",
      "block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\n",
      "the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\n",
      "in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\n",
      "it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\n",
      "reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\n",
      "to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\n",
      "described in section 3.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\n",
      "of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\n",
      "used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\n",
      "textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n",
      "\n",
      "End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\n",
      "language modeling tasks [34].\n",
      "\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\n",
      "entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\n",
      "self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3 Model Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\n",
      "Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\n",
      "of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\n",
      "sequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n",
      "\n",
      "[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",

      "respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3.1** **Encoder and Decoder Stacks**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Encoder:** The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
      "sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\n",
      "the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\n",
      "LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\n",
      "itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",
      "layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decoder:** The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\n",
      "sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\n",
      "attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\n",
      "around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\n",

      "#### 4 Why Self-Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n",
      "(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ R[d], such as a hidden\n",
      "layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\n",
      "consider three desiderata.\n",
      "\n",
      "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
      "be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
      "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
      "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
      "traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
      "and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\n",
      "the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
      "different layer types.\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
      "executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\n",
      "computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",

      "\n",
      "-----\n",
      "\n",
      "length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\n",
      "sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n",
      "\n",
      "[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\n",
      "very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n",
      "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
      "path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
      "\n",
      "A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\n",
      "positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\n",
      "or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\n",
      "between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\n",
      "recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\n",

      "on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\n",
      "English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\n",
      "model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\n",
      "plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\n",
      "to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\n",

Motivating our use of self-attention we\\\\nconsider three desiderata.\\\\n\\\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\", \"As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\\\n\\\\n#### 5 Training\\\\n\\\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\\\n\\\\n**5.1** **Training Data and Batching**\", \"-----\\\\n\\\\n### Input-Input Layer5\\\\n#### Attention Visualizations\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: An example of the attention mechanism following long-distance dependencies in the\\\\nencoder self-attention in layer 5 of 6.
